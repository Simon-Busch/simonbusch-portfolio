          I am an open minded, flexible and driven person raised in Belgium, my previous work experiences allowed me to <a href="https://simonstravels.herokuapp.com/" class="world_travel" target="_blank">travel the world</a>, which forged my character, made me focused and remote-friendly.
          <br><br>
          Passionate about web development, constantly eager to learn new skills, I completed <span>Le Wagon</span> Lausanne, where I learned all the tools to be a <span>Fullstack Web Developper</span>.
          <br><br>
          As we did our half our bootcamp on remote, I learned to work and build projects <span>remotely</span> with a team, which we did successfully.
